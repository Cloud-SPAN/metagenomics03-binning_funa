In this lesson we will be discussing how to assign metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) by making bins of the contigs in the assembly. We will talk about the importance of binning, which software to use for the binning and how to quality control any bins that you can create. We will also demonstrate how to annotate your MAGs to identify the open reading frames (ORFs) and predict the function of your MAGs. We will also cover how to use identify KEGG ids from the ORFs that have been predicted and build a 16S tree. At the end of this lesson we will also talk about other resources that may be useful to you if you perform more metagenomics analysis in the future.
