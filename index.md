In this final lesson we will finish off our analysis by separating out the individual genomes into metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) using a process called binning. We will cover which software to use for binning and how to check the quality of the bins we create.

We will then go on to annotate our MAGs by identifying the open reading frames and predicting their functions.

We will also see how to look up our predicted gene sequences in a database called KEGG, and use this information to build a phylogenetic tree based on 16S ribosomal RNA sequences.

Finally, we will briefly discuss other resources which may be useful to you for metagenomic analysis in future.
