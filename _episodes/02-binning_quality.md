## Quality check

The quality of a metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) or bin is highly dependent on the depth of sequencing, the abundance of the organism in the community and and how successful the assembly and polishing (if any) was.

In order to determine the quality of a MAG we can look at two different metrics. These are the completeness (i.e. how much of the genome is captured in the MAG) and contamination (i.e. do all the sequences in the MAG belong to the same organism).

We can use the program [CheckM](https://github.com/Ecogenomics/CheckM) to determine the quality of MAGs. CheckM uses a collection of domain and lineage-specific markers to estimate completeness and contamination of a MAG. Here is a [short youtube video](https://youtu.be/sLtSDs3sh6k) by Dr Robert Edwards that explains how CheckM uses a hidden Markov model to calculate the level of contamination and completeness of bins, based on marker gene sets.

CheckM has multiple different workflows available which are appropriate for different datasets, see [CheckM documentation on Workflows](https://github.com/Ecogenomics/CheckM/wiki/Workflows) for more information.

We will be using the lineage workflow here. `lineage_wf` places your bins in a reference tree to determine which lineage it corresponds to in order to use the appropriate marker genes to estimate the quality parameters.

CheckM has been pre-installed on the instance so we can first check the help documentation.

We will run the lineage workflow and will specify that our bins are in FASTA format, that they are located in the `Metabat2` directory and that we want our output in the `checkM/` directory. We will be using the `reduced_tree` option to keep our RAM consumption to 16Gb, and `-t 4` to set the number of thread to 4 because these are available on the instance and will speed up the process. If you are on a High performance computing cluster (HPC), you can remove the reduced_tree option.
~~~
cd ~/analysis/
mkdir checkM
checkm lineage_wf  -x fasta Metabat2/ checkM/ --reduced_tree -t 4 -o 2 --tab_table -f MAGs_checkm.tsv
~~~
{: .bash}

The run will end with our results in a file called which we can open with `less MAGs_checkm.tsv`

{: .output}

Running this workflow means that we run four checkM commands in one go rather than individually. This is outlined [here](https://github.com/Ecogenomics/CheckM/wiki/Workflows), which shows lineage_wf is equivalent to running the following commands:

~~~
  checkm tree <bin folder> <output folder>
  checkm tree_qa <output folder>
  checkm lineage_set <output folder> <marker file>
  checkm analyze <marker file> <bin folder> <output folder>
  checkm qa <marker file> <output folder>
  checkm qa checkM/checkM.ms checkM/ --file checkM/MAGs_checkm.tsv --tab_table -o 2
~~~
{: .bash}


Ideally, we would like to get only one contig per bin, with a length similar the genome size of the corresponding taxa. Since this scenario is very difficult to obtain we can use parameters that show us how good is our assembly. Here are some of the most common metrics:
If we arrange our contigs by size, from larger to smaller, and divide the whole sequence in half, N50 is the size of the smallest contig in the half that has the larger contigs; and L50 is the number of contigs in this half of the sequence. So we want big N50 and small L50 values for our genomes. Read [Whatâ€™s N50?](https://www.molecularecologist.com/2017/03/29/whats-n50/).

To get the table with these extra parameters we need to specify the file of the markers that CheckM used in the previous step `checkM.ms`, the name of the output file we want `MAGs_checkm.tsv`, that we want a table `--tab_table`, and the option number 2 `-o 2` is to ask for the extra parameters printed on the table. This means we will run the checkm qa part of the workflow again seperately with these addition commands:

~~~
  checkm qa checkM/checkM.ms checkM/ --file checkM/MAGs_checkm.tsv --tab_table -o 2
~~~
{: .bash}

The question of, how much contamination we can tolerate and how much completeness do we need, certainly depends on the scientific question being tackled, but in the [CheckM](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/25/7/1043) paper, there are some parameters that we can follow.

## Other binning methods

Generating metagenome bins can be challenging, especially in complex community samples or where degradation of the DNA has resulted in a very incomplete assembly and short contig lengths. You might find that a different binning method might result in better refined MAGs for your dataset. There are lots of other binning software methods, [CONCOCT](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3103) and [Maxbin2](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/32/4/605/1744462) being two popular alternatives. There are also tools that can combine different binning methods and use them to refine, [DAS tool](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0171-1) being one of them. DAS tool can also give completeness information, similarly to checkM.
